Imago is an image viewer application for Linux based on Qt.

Current set of features:
- View the images from a directory and its sub-directory/ies in alphabetical order upon opening of an image
- Start a slide show 

TODOs:
- Make a much needed user preferences window to expose some settings
- Use OpenGL to draw the images on screen
- Use OpenImageIO to read and write images
- Possible support for reading PDF files?
