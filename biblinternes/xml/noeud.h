/** Noeud is a base class for every object that is in the

	Nodes have siblings, a parent, and children which can
	be navigated. A node is always in a Document.
	The type of a Noeud can be queried, and it can
	be cast to its more defined type.

	A Document allocates memory for all its Nodes.
	When the Document gets deleted, all its Nodes
	will also be deleted.
